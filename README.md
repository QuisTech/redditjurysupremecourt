## 🎯 Inspiration

Reddit is already the internet's largest courtroom. Millions judge strangers' actions daily in communities like r/AmITheAsshole. We asked: _What if passive judgment became active justice?_

**Reddit Jury** transforms casual moral debates into an immersive judicial experience—complete with evidence examination, dramatic verdicts, and satirical legal opinions.

### The Evolution

**Phase 1 Vision:** A cutting-edge multi-modal AI playground with real-time courtroom sketches, professional voiceovers, and three specialized Gemini models.

**Phase 2 Reality:** When Reddit's platform constraints forced us to pivot, we didn't compromise—we innovated. The result? A smarter, leaner architecture that preserves 90% of our original vision while adding features we never imagined.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

### Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Custom physics engine for "gavel" mechanic

**Backend**

- Reddit Devvit (server-side rendering & state)
- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (AI case generation & verdicts)
- Redis (via Devvit Key-Value Store)

**Audio/Video**

- Browser-native `window.speechSynthesis` API (zero-cost TTS)
- MediaRecorder API with virtual camera system
- Web Audio API for sound effects

**Deployment**

- **Reddit:** Full Devvit integration with Redis backend
- **Vercel:** Standalone web version with localStorage fallbacks

### Architectural Innovation

We built **two complete architectures**:

1. **Devvit Version:** Server-side AI with Redis state management
2. **Standalone Version:** Client-side case library with localStorage persistence

Both share 95% of the same codebase through intelligent abstraction layers.

## 💪 Challenges We Overcame

### Phase 1: The Ambitious Vision

- **Multi-Modal Sync:** Coordinating AI-generated audio, images, and text
- **Prompt Engineering:** Teaching LLMs to be satirically critical without triggering safety filters
- **Real-Time Performance:** Generating media on-the-fly without latency

### Phase 2: The Platform Reality

- **Reddit's Sandbox:** Devvit couldn't support our multi-modal AI vision
- **API Limitations:** Strict external call limits forced architectural redesign
- **Resource Constraints:** Memory/processing caps required aggressive optimization
- **Offline Reliability:** Building seamless fallbacks for API failures
- **Browser Restrictions:** Working around autoplay policies and iframe sandboxing

### Our Solution

Instead of compromising, we **built smarter**:

- Consolidated 3 AI models into 1 optimized Gemini instance
- Replaced expensive TTS APIs with browser-native synthesis
- Created a 100+ case offline library with pre-written verdicts
- Designed a dual-deployment strategy (Reddit + Vercel)

## 🏆 Accomplishments

✨ **Director's Mode**  
First-of-its-kind automated video creation within Reddit's constraints—complete with virtual camera tracking and browser TTS narration.

🎯 **Platform Adaptation**  
Successfully pivoted from multi-AI architecture to single-model optimization without losing core gameplay.

⚖️ **The "Gavel" Feel**  
Perfected physics and audio design that makes voting feel consequential and satisfying.

🔊 **Zero-Cost Audio**  
Implemented fully functional TTS using browser-native APIs—no external services required.

🌐 **Seamless Offline Experience**  
Fallback system so robust that users never know when they're offline.

🏗️ **Dual Architecture**  
Designed, built, and deployed two complete technical solutions for different platforms.

## 📚 What We Learned

1. **Constraint Breeds Innovation**  
   Reddit's limitations forced us to build smarter, not bigger.

2. **The 90% Rule**  
   You can preserve most of a vision with clever architecture, even with significant constraints.

3. **Hybrid is Heroic**  
   Server-side AI + client-side interactivity = best of both worlds.

4. **Browser APIs are Underrated**  
   Native capabilities can replace expensive external services.

5. **Prompt Engineering = Game Design**  
   System prompts became our primary game balancing tool.

6. **Imperfection Adds Charm**  
   Sometimes "good enough" AI responses enhance humor and replayability.

7. **Architecture Flexibility Matters**  
   The ability to pivot technical approaches is as important as the initial vision.

## 🚀 What's Next

### Short-Term (Platform-Compatible)

- 👥 **Multiplayer Juries:** Real-time lobbies for group deliberations
- 📝 **User Appeals:** Community-driven case submissions
- 🎨 **LCARS Interface:** Sci-fi legal aesthetic overhaul
- 🔗 **Reddit Integration:** Auto-pull cases from r/AITA

### Long-Term (When Platform Evolves)

- 🖼️ **Multi-Modal Return:** AI-generated courtroom sketches
- 🎙️ **Advanced Voice Synthesis:** Professional-grade AI narration
- 🎲 **Procedural Evidence:** Dynamic case elements based on decisions
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform Expansion:** Beyond Reddit

**Our Promise:** We've built an architecture that scales with platform capabilities—when Reddit's constraints ease, our original multi-modal vision is ready to deploy.
